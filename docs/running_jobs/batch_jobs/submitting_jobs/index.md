# Submitting Batch Jobs

## Submitting a Job

To submit a batch job to the scheduler, use the command ```sbatch```. This will place your job in line for execution and will return a job ID that you can use to [track and monitor your job](../../system_commands/). 

As an example:

```
[netid@gpu66 hello_world]$ sbatch hello_world.slurm
Submitted batch job 807387
[netid@gpu66 hello_world]$ squeue --job 807387
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES
            807387  standard hello_wo    netid PD       0:06      1 
```

The command ```squeue``` gives us detailed information about our batch jobs while they're in queue or running. Under ```ST``` you can check the state of your job. In this case, it's pending (```PD```) which means it's waiting in line with other jobs. Once the job starts running, it's state will change to ```R```, and when the job has completed running, ```squeue``` will return a blank line. 




## Submitting Multiple Jobs
Frequently, users need to submit multiple, related jobs. It may be tempting to do this using a bash loop but there are several drawbacks to this method which are discussed under [Best Practices](../../overview/#jobs). 

The best way to submit related jobs is to use job arrays. Jobs arrays allow users to submit multiple related jobs using a single script and single ```sbatch``` command. Each task within the array can have its own unique input parameters, making it ideal for running batch jobs with varied inputs or executing repetitive tasks efficiently. See [Array Jobs](../array_jobs/) for specifics on how to submit these sorts of workflows.



## Output Files

Once your job completes, you should see an output file {==in the directory where you submitted the batch script==}. This output file captures anything that would have been printed to the terminal if you had run it interactively. By default, output filenames will be ```slurm-<jobid>.out```(1). In the example above, this translates to filename ```slurm-807387.out```. 
{ .annotate }
