## Overview

[Globus](https://www.globus.org/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

GridFTP is an extension of the standard File transfer Protocol (FTP) for high-speed, reliable, and secure data transfer. Because GridFTP provides a more reliable and high performance file transfer (compared to protocols such as SCP or rsync), it enables the transmission of very large files. GridFTP also addresses the problem of incompatibility between storage and access systems. (You can read more about the advantages of GridFTP [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GridFTP)).

To use GridFTP, we recommend you use Globus. Globus uses endpoints to make transfers.
