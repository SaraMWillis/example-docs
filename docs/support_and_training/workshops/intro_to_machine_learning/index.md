# Machine Learning on HPC 

## About 

We see a lot of growth in the use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning across many domains. We provide two workshops, one in Python and the other in R, that provide some basic ML information and some hands-on exercises. Once you have an HPC account you can use our Jupyter notebooks or RStudio. You can also do the exercises on your laptop. We can also bring these to department meetings.

There are many courses you can take online if you want to increase your knowledge of Machine Learning or Deep Learning.  Here is a popular one: [https://course.fast.ai/](https://course.fast.ai/)
