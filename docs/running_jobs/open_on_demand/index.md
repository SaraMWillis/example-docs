## File Browser

The file browser provides easy access to your ```/home```, ```/xdisk```, and ```/groups``` directories and allows you to view, edit, copy, and rename your files. You may also transfer small files between HPC and your local workstation using this interface. For larger transfers, see our section on Transferring Data for more efficient methods.
