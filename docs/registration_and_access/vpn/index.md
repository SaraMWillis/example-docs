# VPN

## Overview

A virtual private network (VPN) is a mechanism for creating a secure connection between a computer and a computing network using an insecure communication medium like the Internet. You can access the resources available within the network from your computer using a VPN.

You will find the following VPN services useful for accessing some of the resources offered by the Research and Discovery Technologies:

* UA SSL VPN (vpn.arizona.edu): If you are not connected to the UA campus network you will need to connect to this VPN to access R-DAS.
* UA HPC VPN (vpn.hpc.arizona.edu): You will need to connect to this VPN to use graphical applications that need X11 forwarding with the HPC clusters.


## Instructions for Connecting



=== "GUI"
    You can connect to the UArizona VPN services with the software Cisco Secure Client. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux distributions. On Linux distributions you might have a better experience with OpenConnect VPN (see CLI). Follow the UITS Knowledge Base guide for [Windows](https://uarizona.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0011053), [Mac](https://uarizona.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010746), or [Linux](https://uarizona.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010416), to install Cisco Secure Client on your computer. The guide also shows how you can connect to the UA SSL VPN.
        
    Follow the steps below to connect to UA HPC VPN (the screenshots are from a Mac, but the experience is similar across OSs):

=== "CLI"
    !!! failure "Use of sudo"
        Do not run any ```sudo``` commands on the HPC clusters when following the instructions below. These are strictly meant for your personal machines.
        
    You can connect to UArizona VPN services from the command line with OpenConnect VPN. To do this, you will need ```sudo``` privileges.
        
    OpenConnect VPN is available for Windows, Mac and Linux distributions, however installation on Windows can be difficult.
