  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <div>
  <p>UArizona High Performance Computing (HPC) is an interdisciplinary research center focused on facilitating research and discoveries that advance science and technology. We deploy and operate advanced computing and data resources for the research activities of students, faculty, and staff at the University of Arizona. We also provide consulting, technical documentation, and training to support our users.
  <br><br>
  This site is divided into sections that describe the High Performance Computing (HPC) resources that are available, how to use them, and the rules for use.</p>

        <h3>Faster Speeds Need Faster Computation</h3>
        <h4>Hypersonic Travel</h4>
        <p> Professors Christoph Hader, Hermann Fasel, and their team are exploring the use of our GPUs to optimize Navier-Stokes codes for simulating the flow field around hypersonic vehicles traveling at size times the speed of sound (Mach 6) or more. <br><br>
        In the image to the right, instantaneous flow structures obtained from a DNS for a flared cone at Mach 6 are visualized using the Q-isocontours colored with instantaneous temperature disturbance values. The small scales towards the end of the computational domain indicate the regions where the boundary layer is turbulent. </p>

      <div class="text"><h3>Puma</h3><br>
      Implemented in the middle of 2020, Puma is the biggest cat yet. Similar to Ocelote, it has standard CPU nodes (with 94 cores and 512 GB of memory per node), GPU nodes (with Nvidia V100) and two high-memory nodes (3 TB). Local scratch storage increased to ~1.4 TB. Puma runs on CentOS 7.<br>
      As is the case for our other supercomputers, we use the RFP process to get the best value for our financial resources, that meet our technical requirements.  This time Penguin Computing one with AMD processors. This is tremendously valuable as each node comes with:<br>
        &ensp;- Two AMD Zen2 48 core processors<br>
        &ensp;- 512GB RAM<br>
        &ensp;- 25Gb path to storage<br>
        &ensp;- 25Gb path to other nodes for MPI<br>
        &ensp;- 2TB internal NVME disk (largely available as /tmp)<br>
        &ensp;- Qumulo all flash storage array for shared filesystems<br>
        &ensp;- Two large memory nodes with 3TB memory and the same processors and memory as the other nodes<br>
        &ensp;- Six nodes with four Nvidia V100S GPU's each <br>

      <div class="text"><h3>Ocelote</h3><br>
      Ocelote arrived in 2016. Lenovo's Nextscale M5 technology was the winner of the RFP mainly on price, performance and meeting our specific requirements. Ocelote has one large memory node with 2TB of memory and 46 nodes with Nvidia P100 GPUs for GPU-accelerated workflows. This cluster is actually the next generation of the IBM cluster we call ElGato. Lenovo purchased IBM's Intel server line in 2015.<br>
      In 2021, Ocelote's operating system was upgraded from CentOS6 to CentOS7 and was configured to use SLURM, like Puma. It will continue until it is either too expensive to maintain or it is replaced by something else.<br>
      &ensp;- Intel Haswell V3 28 core processors<br>
      &ensp;- 192GB RAM per node<br>
      &ensp;- FDR infiniband for fast MPI interconnect<br>
      &ensp;- Qumulo all flash storage array (all HPC storage is integrated into one array)<br>
      &ensp;- One large memory node with 2TB RAM,  Intel Ivy Bridge V2 48 cores<br>
      &ensp;- 46 nodes with Nvidia P100 GPU's<br>

    Implemented at the start of 2014, ElGato has been reprovisioned with CentOS 7 and new compilers and libraries. From July 2021 it has been using Slurm for job submission. ElGato is our smallest cluster with 130 standard nodes each with 16 CPUs. Purchased by an NSF MRI grant by researchers in Astronomy and SISTA.
