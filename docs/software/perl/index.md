# Perl

## Accessibility


Perl is installed on the operating system of each node and is currently at 5.16.3: 

```bash
[netid@compute_hostname ~]$ perl --version
 
This is perl 5, version 16, subversion 3 (v5.16.3) built for x86_64-linux-thread-multi
(with 44 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)
...
```

## Perl Module Policy

We provide a version of perl through modules or the operating. Installation of additional user libraries can be done in a perl environment using ```perl-virtualenv```.

For a helpful Perl tutorial, see: [http://www.tutorialspoint.com/perl/perl_modules.htm](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/perl/perl_modules.htm). Additionally, O'Reilly Media is a well regarded source for Perl 

### Installing Perl Packages Using perl-virtualenv

One of the best things about Perl is the number of packages provided by the user community. Installing packages generally requires root access but that is not a viable solution in the HPC environment.

An easy solution is to use perl-virtualenv to create a consistent personal Perl environment that will persist for each time you log in. An example of usage:

```bash
[netid@i0n1 ~]$ perl-virtualenv my_project    # Create virtual environment
perl path: /usr/bin/perl
venv path: /home/uxx/netid/my_project
[netid@i0n1 ~]$ source my_project/bin/activate # Activate virtual environment
(my_project)[netid@i0n1 ~]$ cpanm -i Config::Trivial
