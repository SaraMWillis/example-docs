# Storage Overview

## Where Should I Store My Data?

1. Data undergoing active analyses should be stored in HPC's local [High Performance Storage](../hpc_storage/).
2. Large amounts of data not requiring immediate access from our HPC compute nodes can be stored at reasonable rates on our [Rental Storage](../rental_storage/). 
3. RDAS is a [research data service](../rdas_storage/) which supports the mounting of SMB shares. The supported operating systems are MacOS, Linux, and Windows. It provides 5TB of free storage. 
4. Research data not requiring immediate access should be stored in [General Research Data Storage (Tier 2)](../tier2_storage/). For example:
    1. Large datasets where only subsets are actively being analyzed
    2. Results no longer requiring immediate access
    3. Backups (highly encouraged!)
5. Data that require HIPAA-compliance can be stored on [Soteria](../../../resources/secure_hpc/overview/) (currently in the pilot phase).

## NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy

The NIH has issued a new [data management and sharing policy](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy), effective January 25, 2023. The university libraries now [offers a comprehensive guide](https://data.library.arizona.edu/data-management/nih-data-management-sharing-policy-2023) for how to navigate these policies and what they mean for you.

> **What's new about the 2023 NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy?**<br><br>
  Previously, the NIH only required grants with $500,000 per year or more in direct costs to provide a brief explanation of how and when data resulting from the grant would be shared.<br><br>
  The 2023 policy is entirely new. Beginning in 2023, ALL grant applications or renewals that generate Scientific Data must now include a robust and detailed plan for how you will manage and share data during the entire funded period. This includes information on data storage, access policies/procedures, preservation, metadata standards, distribution approaches, and more. You must provide this information in a data management and sharing plan (DMSP). The DMSP is similar to what other funders call a data management plan (DMP).<br><br>
  The DMSP will be assessed by NIH Program Staff (though peer reviewers will be able to comment on the proposed data management budget). The Institute, Center, or Office (ICO)-approved plan becomes a Term and Condition of the Notice of Award.
