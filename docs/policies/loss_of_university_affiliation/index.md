# Loss of University Affiliation

## Affiliation Loss Policy

Losing affiliation with the university (e.g. via graduating, leaving a work position, etc) will result in the denial of access to HPC resources. This will happen automatically on the day of termination according to the University of Arizona Records Database. 

We unfortunately cannot extend HPC access prior to or after affiliation loss, however, if you require continued access to HPC services, you may register as a [Designated Campus Colleague (DCC)](https://it.arizona.edu/service/designated-campus-colleague-accounts) through Human Resources. Once your DCC status is approved, you may request sponsorship from a university faculty member. 

## Data After Affiliation Loss

Home directory data are maintained for 90 days following affiliation loss. If university affiliation is reestablished and HPC access is restored within those 90 days, when you log into HPC again you will have access to your files. Data in shared storage (e.g. ```/groups``` or ```/xdisk```) persist for as long as the storage location is available and are not deleted after a user loses access to the system.
