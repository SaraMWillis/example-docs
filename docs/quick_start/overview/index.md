Just getting started with our HPC and don't know where to start? You've found the place!

If you're using an HPC system for the first time, this tutorial is designed to give you the basic tools to get you started. 

If you're experienced with HPC already but haven't used our system, this guide is intended to help familiarize you with the specifics of our HPC clusters. This should help you get up and running quickly since every HPC system is slightly different; each with its own specific commands, allocation policy, partitions, accounts, and even system layout. 

By the end of this quick start, you should know:

1. What HPC is
2. How HPC is structured
3. How to log in
4. How to access computational resources
5. How to access software
