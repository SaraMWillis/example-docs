# Intro to HPC 

## About

We encourage you to take training course to help you get started on using HPC resources. If you have recently started, you might learn there is a better way, or there are capabilities you are not taking advantage of. Either attend the workshops which are held once each semester or view the video attached below. We can also bring these to department meetings.
