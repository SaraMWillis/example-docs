# Overview

The HPC is a shared system, and its resources are in high demand. Computational work must be run on dedicated compute resources. These resources are granted to each user for a limited time per session, and sessions are organized by [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/), an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster manager and task scheduler. Users can interact  with Slurm from one of the login nodes to start an interactive job or submit a batch job..

???+ warning "Login Nodes"
    Do not run intensive programs or calculations on the Login Nodes. These are shared nodes that are not intended for computation. Instead, please request computing resources by following the directions in these pages. 


Below is a FAQ that includes answers to common questions and misconceptions about running jobs on HPC. Many of these are general information about HPC systems, but some contain information specific to the UA HPC. We recommend reviewing this FAQ whether you are a new user getting started on our system, or an experienced user returning to our documentation.

<button class="collapsible">What is a Job?</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>A single instance of an allocation selection of computing resources is known as a Job. Jobs can be in the format of a graphical <a href="../open_on_demand">Open OnDemand application</a> instance, <a href="../interactive_jobs">interactive</a> terminal session, or <a href="../batch_jobs">batch submission</a> (a script scheduled for  execution at a later time), and require an active allocation of CPU-time under an associated PI account. Each PI is granted a standard monthly allocation of 100,000 CPU-hrs on Puma; 70,000 CPU-hrs on Ocelote; and 7,000 CPU-hrs on El Gato. See <a href="../allocations">Time Allocations</a> for more information.
