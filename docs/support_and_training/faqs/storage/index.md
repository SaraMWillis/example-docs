<button class="collapsible">Do you allow users to NFS mount their own storage onto the compute nodes?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
       No. We NFS mount storage across all compute nodes so that data is available independent of which compute nodes are used. See our page on <a href="../../storage_and_transfers/transfers/">transferring data</a> for more information.

      After creating your HPC Account, your home directory will not be created until you log in for the first time. Without your home directory, you will not be able to transfer your data to HPC. If you are struggling and receiving errors, sign into your account either <a href="../../../registration_and_access/system_access/#command-line-access">using the CLI through the bastion</a> or logging into <a href="../../../registration_and_access/system_access/#web-access">Open OnDemand</a> and then try again.

<button class="collapsible">I accidentally deleted files, can I get them back?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
      Unfortunately, no. Backups are not made and anything deleted is permanently erased. It is impossible for us to recover it. To ensure your data are safe, we recommend:
      <ul>
          <li>Make frequent backups, ideally in three places and two formats. Helpful information on making backups can be found on our page <a href="../../../storage_and_transfers/transfers/overview/">Transferring Data</a>.</li>
          <li>Use <code>rm</code> and <code>rm -r</code> with caution as these commands cannot be undone! Consider using <code>rm -i</code> when removing files/directories. The <code>-i</code> flag will prompt you to manually confirm file removals to make <i>really</i> sure they can be deleted.</li>
          <li>You can open <a href="../../../support_and_training/consulting_services/">a support ticket</a> to request assistance.  Files that are deleted may not have been removed from the storage array immediately (though this is not guaranteed), don't wait more than a few days.</li>
      </ul>

<!-- My home directory is full, what's using all the space? -->
<button class="collapsible">My home directory is full, what's using all the space?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
      If your home directory is full and you can't find what is taking up all the space, it's possible the culprit is a hidden file or directory. Hidden objects are used for storing libraries, cached singularity/apptainer objects, saved R session, anaconda environments, configuration files, and more. It's important to be careful with hidden, or "dot", files since they often control your environment and modifying them can lead to unintended consequences.<br><br>
      To view the sizes of all the objects (including hidden) in your home, one quick command is <code>du -hs $(ls -A ~)</code>, for example:
      <pre><code>
[netid@junonia ~]$ du -hs $(ls -A ~)
32K     Archives
192M    bin
4.7G    Software
46M     .anaconda
1.9M    .ansys
4.0K    .apptainer
16K     .bash_history
4.0K    .bash_logout
4.0K    .bash_profile
12K     .bashrc
20M     ondemand
      </code></pre>

<button class="collapsible">I'd like to share data I have stored on HPC with an external collaborator, is this possible?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
      Unfortunately, without active university credentials it is not possible to access HPC compute or storage resources. External collaborates who need ongoing access may apply for <a href="https://hr.arizona.edu/workforce-systems/uaccess-resources/designated-campus-colleagues">Designated Campus Colleague, or DCC, status</a>. This is a process done through HR and will give the applicant active university credentials allowing them to receive HPC sponsorship.
      <br>
      Otherwise, data will need to be moved off HPC and made available on a mutually-accessible platform. This may include (but is not limited to): Google Drive, AWS S3, Box, and <a href="https://cyverse.org/data-store">CyVerse's Data Store</a>.

<h3>xdisk</h3>
<!-- Can someone other than a PI manage a group's xdisk? -->
<button class="collapsible">Can someone other than a PI manage a group's xdisk?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Yes, a PI can add a trusted group member as a delegate by following the instructions in our <a href="../../../registration_and_access/group_management/
#delegating-group-management-rights">Research and Class Groups</a> page. Once a group member is added as a delegate, they can manage the group's xdisk allocation on behalf of their PI in the user portal.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Who owns our group's /xdisk? -->
<button class="collapsible">Who owns our group's /xdisk?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
      A group's PI owns the xdisk allocation. By default, your PI has exclusive read/write/execute privileges for the root folder <code>/xdisk/pi_netid</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Can a PI make their /xdisk accessible to their whole group? -->
<button class="collapsible">Can a PI make their /xdisk writeable for their whole group? </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
      By default, members of a research group only have write access to their subdirectories under <code>/xdisk/pi_netid</code>. If they so choose, a PI may allow their group members to write directly to that location by running the following command:
      <pre><code>
chmod g+w /xdisk/pi_netid
      </code></pre>
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Where can group members store their files? -->
<button class="collapsible">Where can group members store their files?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
      When an xdisk allocation is created, a subdirectory is automatically generated for and owned by each individual group member. If the directory <code>/xdisk/pi_netid</code> does not have group privileges, group members may not access the root directory, but may access their individual spaces by:
      <pre><code>
cd /xdisk/pi_netid/netid
      </code></pre>
      If a user joins the group after the xdisk was created and <code>/xdisk/pi_netid</code> is not writeable for group members, <a href="../../../consulting_services/">contact our consultants</a> and they can create one.

  <p>
      Typically when an xdisk allocation is created, it will automatically generate a directory for each group member. In the unlikely event that it doesn't or, more commonly, a group member is added after the allocation has been created, <a href="../../consulting_services/">contact our consultants</a> and they can create one.

  <p>
      xdisks are managed by your group's PI by default. This means if you want to request an xdisk or modify an existing allocation (e.g., extending the time limit or increasing the storage quota), you will need to consult your PI. Your PI may either perform these actions directly or, if they want to delegate xdisk management to a group member, they may do so by following the instructions under <a href="../../../registration_and_access/group_management/
#delegating-group-management-rights">Delegating Group Management Rights</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- How can we modify our xdisk allocation? -->
<button class="collapsible">How can we modify our xdisk allocation?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
      To modify your allocation's time limit or storage quota, your PI can either do so through <a href="https://portal.hpc.arizona.edu/portal/">the Web Portal</a> under the Storage tab, or via <a href="../../../storage_and_transfers/storage/hpc_storage/#cli-commands">the command line</a>. If your PI would like to delegate management rights to a group member, they may follow the instructions under <a href="../../../registration_and_access/group_management/
#delegating-group-management-rights">Delegating Group Management Rights</a>. Once a group member has received management rights, they may manage the allocation through our web portal.

<div class="content">
  <p>
      If you're getting errors using xdisk commands in a terminal session, check that you are on a login node. If you are on the bastion host (hostname: gatekeeper), are in an interactive session, or are on the filexfer node, you won't be able to check or modify your xdisk. When you are on a login node, your terminal prompt should show the hostname junonia or wentletrap. You can also check your hostname using the command <code>hostname</code>

<!-- Why am I getting errors when trying to extend my allocation? -->
<button class="collapsible">Why am I getting errors when trying to extend my allocation?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
      If you're trying to extend your group's allocation but are seeing something like:
      <pre><code>
(puma) [netid@junonia ~]$ xdisk -c expire -d 1
invalid request_days: 1
      </code></pre>
      for every value you enter, your xdisk has likely reached its maximum time limit. To check, have a delegate or PI go to <a href="portal.hpc.arizona.edu">portal.hpc.arizona.edu</a>, click <b>Manage XDISK</b>, and look at the box next to Duration. If you see 300, your allocation cannot be extended further.

    If your allocation is at its limit, you will need to back up your data to external storage (e.g., a local machine, lab server, or cloud service). Once your xdisk has been removed (either by expiring or through manual deletion), you can immediately create a new allocation and restore your data. Detailed xdisk information can be found on our <a href="../../../storage_and_transfers/storage/hpc_storage/">HPC High Performance Storage</a> page. You may also want to look at our page on <a href="../../../storage_and_transfers/transfers/overview/">Transferring Data</a>.

<!-- Can we keep our xdisk allocation for more than 300 days?  -->
<button class="collapsible">Can we keep our xdisk allocation for more than 300 days?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
      No, once an xdisk has reached its time limit it will expire. It's a good idea to start preparing for this early by making frequent backups and paying attention to xdisk expiration emails. 
  </p>

<!-- What happens when our xdisk allocation expires?  -->
<button class="collapsible">What happens when our xdisk allocation expires?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
      Once an xdisk expires, all the associated data are deleted. Deleted data are non-retrievable since HPC is not backed up. It's advised to keep frequent backups of your data on different platforms, for example a local hard drive or a cloud-based service, or (even better) both! Check our <a href="../../../storage_and_transfers/storage/hpc_storage/">Storage documentation</a> for more information on alternative storage offerings.

<!-- What's the best way to backup/transfer our data before our xdisk expires?  -->
<button class="collapsible">What's the best way to backup/transfer our data before our xdisk expires?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
      Before your group's xdisk expires, you'll want to make an external backup of anything you need to keep. External storage options include personal computers, lab servers, external hard drives, or cloud services such as AWS. 

    If you're moving large quantities of data, Globus is a great option. We have instructions in our <a href="../../../storage_and_transfers/transfers/globus/">Globus documentation</a> for setting up and using this software.

    We strongly recommend making archives (.tar, .zip, files etc.) of large directories prior to transferring them off the system. In general, transfer software struggles with moving many small files and performs much more efficiently moving fewer large files. You will get the better transfer speeds (sometimes by orders of magnitude) if you compress your files prior to transferring them. This can be done on our filexfer node which is designed for large file management operations (hostname: filexfer.hpc.arizona.edu).
