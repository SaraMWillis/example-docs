# Intro to Parallel Computing

## About 

!!! tip
    For an additional material on parallel computing, check out [Lawrence Livermore Labs' tutorial](https://hpc.llnl.gov/documentation/tutorials/introduction-parallel-computing-tutorial). 

The best way to take advantage of our clusters is to use the parallel capabilities.  This can mean using all the cores on each compute node or combining several nodes with MPI.  This workshop will give you a quick view of the concepts and how we implement them.

At the bottom of this page is another course from Lawrence Livermore Labs that you may find interesting.
