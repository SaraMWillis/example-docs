# X11 Forwarding

X11 forwarding is a mechanism that allows a user to start up a remote application (e.g. VisIt or Matlab) and forward the application display to their local machine. The key to make forwarding work successfully is to include the ```-X``` flag at each login step. To check whether X11 forwarding is active, you may run the command:

```bash
$ echo $DISPLAY
```
If it comes back blank, X11 forwarding is not enabled.


=== "Mac/Linux"
    ???+ tip "Tips"
        *  Mac users will want to install the additional software package XQuartz onto their machines to use X11 forwarding with HPC. 
            
        * On a Mac, if you get a blank response to ```echo $DISPLAY```, you might need this line in your ```~/.ssh/config``` file: ```ForwardX11Trusted yes```
   
        * Be aware forwarding X traffic does not work with the DEPRECATED menu interface enabled.  You should disable the menu option and use the hostname shortcuts instead.
    Start a terminal session and connect as you typically would with an additional flag ```-X``` in your ssh command. Once you're connected to the bastion host, enter the name of the cluster you want to access, including the additional ```-X``` flag again. An example of this process is provided below:
    ```bash
    $ ssh -X netid@hpc.arizona.edu
    Password:
    Duo two-factor login for netid
    Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:
 
    1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-8969
    2. Phone call to XXX-XXX-8969
    3. Phone call to XXX-XXX-0502
    4. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-8969
 
    Passcode or option (1-4): 1
    Success. Logging you in...
    Last login:
    This is a bastion host used to access the rest of the RT/HPC environment.
  
    Type "shell" to access the job submission hosts for all environments
    -----------------------------------------            
    [netid@gatekeeper ~]$ echo $DISPLAY
    localhost:13.0
 
    [netid@gatekeeper ~]$ shell -X
    ***
    The default cluster for job submission is Puma
    ***
    Shortcut commands change the target cluster
    -----------------------------------------
    Ocelote:
    $ ocelote
    (ocelote) $
    Puma:
    $ puma
    (puma) $
 
    (puma)[netid@junonia ~]$ echo $DISPLAY
    localhost:18.0
    ```
=== "Windows"
    To use X11 forwarding on a Windows system, you will need to download an X11 display server such as Xming. 
        
    === "PuTTY"
        To enable X11 forwarding in PuTTY, go to SSH â†’ X11 and select the box next to Enable X11 forwarding.

        Once you've connected to the bastion host, connect to the login nodes with the an additional flag ```-X```:
            
        ```bash
        shell -X
        ```
    === "MobaXterm"
