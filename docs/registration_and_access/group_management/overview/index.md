# Group Management

HPC groups are ways for faculty members to manage file permissions, job allocations, and group members. There are two types: **Research Groups** and **Class Groups**.

* Research groups include any faculty, postdocs, graduate students, DCCs, staff, or student workers actively affiliated with your group's research. 
* Class groups are for educational purposes only and will include students enrolled in a semester-long course.
