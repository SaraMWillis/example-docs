# File Browser

The file browser provides easy access to your ```/home```, ```/xdisk```, and ```/groups``` directories and allows you to view, edit, copy, and rename your files. You may also transfer small files between HPC and your local workstation using this interface. For larger transfers, see our section on [Transferring Data](../../../storage_and_transfers/transfers/overview/) for more efficient methods.

## Access

In the browser at the top of the screen, select the Files dropdown

You will be able to select your home directory, ```/groups```, or ```/xdisk```. If you select ```/groups``` or ```/xdisk```, enter your PI's NetID in the Filter field to find your shared group space.

This will bring up a popup where you can open a file browser to search for your files. Alternatively, you can drag/drop files/directories onto the tile.
