# Globus

## Overview

[Globus](https://www.globus.org/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

GridFTP is an extension of the standard File transfer Protocol (FTP) for high-speed, reliable, and secure data transfer. Because GridFTP provides a more reliable and high performance file transfer (compared to protocols such as SCP or rsync), it enables the transmission of very large files. GridFTP also addresses the problem of incompatibility between storage and access systems. (You can read more about the advantages of GridFTP [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GridFTP)).

To use GridFTP, we recommend you use Globus. Globus uses endpoints to make transfers. 

A list of endpoint names managed by HPC are shown below for reference. For more information on usage, see [HPC-Managed Globus Endpoints](#hpc-managed-globus-endpoints) below. 

|Endpoint Name|Data Storage|
|-|-|
|UA HPC Filesystems|[HPC's main storage array](../../storage/hpc_storage/) (access to home, xdisk, and groups)|
|UA Rental Storage Filesystem|[HPC rental storage](../../storage/rental_storage/)|
|Tier 2 AWS Storage|[HPC-managed AWS S3 buckets](../../storage/tier2_storage/)|
|UA HPC HIPAA Filesystems|[Soteria](../../../resources/secure_hpc/overview/)|

## Accessing Globus

## Globus Connect Personal

To transfer files to/from your personal computer with Globus, you'll need to have a local endpoint set up. This can be achieved using Globus Connect Personal. Official documentation on how to install the relevant software and configure a local endpoint can be found in [Globus' offical how-to documentation](https://docs.globus.org/how-to/). An overview is shown for Mac, Linux, and Windows below.

To start, regardless of operating system, go to [https://www.globus.org/](https://www.globus.org/), log in, navigate to the **Collections** tab, and select Get Globus Connect Personal

## HPC Managed Globus Endpoints

HPC managed endpoints allow you to connect to HPC-affiliated storage to initiate transfers. Transfers can be made between any two endpoints; for example, allowing you to make transfers between your own personal computer and HPC storage, between HPC storage (`/home`, `/groups`, or `/xdisk`) and a rental option (such as Tier 2 AWS buckets or HPC rental storage), or between HPC and another institution's endpoint.

Below are a list of HPC managed endpoints and how to configure them:

=== "HPC Storage"
    The endpoint for HPC can be found by searching {==**UA HPC Filesystems**==} under the **Collections** tab.

    <img src="images/ua_hpc_filesystems_endpoint.png" style="width:100%;">
    
    Click the result, then click **Open in File Manager** to access your HPC files.

    <img src="images/open_hpc_filesystems_manager.png" style="width:100%;">

    The default location is your /home on HPC. You can navigate through by double-clicking directories, or by entering a full path in the **Path** search bar and hitting enter. This method can be used to access any /xdisk or /groups directories you have access to.

    <img src="images/hpc_home_directory.png" style="width:100%;">
    
    


=== "Rental Storage"

    The endpoint for [rental storage](../../storage/rental_storage/) (found on the filexfer nodes under ```/rental```) can be found by searching {==**UA Rental Storage Filesystem**==} under the **Collections** tab.

    <img src="images/globus_rental_endpoint.png" style="width:100%;">

    This will open details on the endpoint. Click **Open in File Manager** to view the contents.

    <img src="images/open_rental_endpoint.png" style="width:100%;">

    The root for this endpoint is /rental. Faculty members who have rented storage will have a directory with their NetID in this space. Find the one relevant to you and double-click to access.

    <img src="images/rental_directory_contents.png" style="width:100%;">

    

    

=== "Tier 2 AWS Storage"

    To access a [Tier 2 AWS S3 bucket](../../storage/tier2_storage/), in the Collections tab, enter {==**UA AWS S3**==} in the search bar. In the results, you should see the name UA AWS S3 show up with the description {==Subscribed Mapped Collection==}. Click the endpoint's name to proceed

    <img src="images/aws_s3_endpoint.png" style="width:100%;">

    Next, select the **Credentials** tab and select Add Credential. If you are prompted for Authentication/Consent, click **Continue**

    <img src="images/aws_s3_credentials_tab.png" style="width:100%;">

    If requested, authenticate by selecting your Arizona email address, then **Allow**. You will then be returned to the Credentials tab. From there, link to your AWS S3 Bucket by entering your public and private keys in the provided fields and click **Continue**.

    <img src="images/add_aws_keys.png" style="width:100%;">

    Once you've added your keys, navigate back to the UA AWS S3 collection, go to the **Collections** tab, and click **Add a Guest Collection** on the right

    <img src="images/add_guest_collection_aws.png" style="width:100%;">

    Under Create New Guest Collection, click **Browse** next to the **Directory** field to find your group's AWS bucket. You will find it under /ua-rt-t2-faculty_netid/ where faculty_netid is the NetID of the faculty member who requested the bucket. Under **Display Name**, enter a descriptive name that you can use to identify your bucket. Once you've completed the process, click **Create Collection** at the bottom of the page.

    !!! tip
        If you encounter Authentication/Consent Required after clicking Browse, click Continue, select your university credentials, and click Allow. That should bring you back to the Browse window.

    <img src="images/aws_collection_details.png" style="width:100%;">

    To find and use your new collection, navigate to the **Collections** tab and select the display name you assigned to your bucket. That will open your collection in the File Manager window allowing you to view the contents and initiate transfers.

    <img src="images/open_aws_collection.png" style="width:100%;">

    If you click the display name, this will open the bucket in the Globus file manager window allowing you to see the contents

    <img src="images/aws_bucket_contents.png" style="width:100%;">


    
    

## Making Transfers

Transfers can be made between any two endpoints of your choosing using the File Manager window in the Globus web application. In this example, we'll make a transfer between a Globus Connect Personal endpoint and the primary HPC storage array.

To start, go to the **File Manager** tab in the Globus web application. Make sure you have the dual-panel mode enabled (upper right-hand corner shown with the red arrow below) to allow you to open two endpoints. Start with opening your first endpoint by clicking the **Search** bar on the left-hand side. 

<img src="images/file-manager-window.png" style="width:100%;">

This will open a window where you can search for your first endpoint. In this example, we'll use **UA HPC Filesystems**. Click the result.

<img src="images/hpc-endpoint-1.png" style="width:100%;">

Now, on the left-hand side you should see the contents of your home directory on HPC. You can navigate through the various directories by double-clicking the folder icons, or can enter a full path in the **Path** search bar. To open a second connection, click the **Search** bar on the right-hand side. 

<img src="images/file-manager-with-endpoint-1.png" style="width:100%;">

You can search for your next endpoint in the same way as we searched for UA HPC Filesystems. You can also find recently used endpoints and your collections (e.g., a Google Drive collection or personal endpoint) under the Recent and Your Collections tabs. In this example, we'll go to Your Collections, find a personal endpoint, and click the result. 

<img src="images/endpoint-2.png" style="width:100%;">

Now you should be back in the File Manager window with two endpoints open. A transfer can be made from one endpoint to another by selecting the item(s) you want to transfer, then clicking the Start button.
