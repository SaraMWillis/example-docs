There are two main types of limits imposed on all jobs: (1) those due to hardware, and (2) those due to policy.

## Hardware Limits

See our page on [Compute Resources](../compute_resources) for more information. In particular, note that there are only a certain number of CPUs available per node, only a certain number of nodes available on each cluster, and that memory and CPU count are linked due to the physical connection of these resources. 

## Policy Limits

The following limits are imposed on all user-submitted jobs as a matter of policy.

- **Wall Time:** The maximum time a job can run for is 10 days, or 240 hours. Any job requesting more than the maximum time will fail. 
- **Others??**
